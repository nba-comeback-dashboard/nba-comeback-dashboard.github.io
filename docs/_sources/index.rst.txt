:doc:`Looking to answer a long-held question </analysis/about>`, I downloaded all games

* :doc:`./analysis/index`: Looks at some trends in the data and tries to answer "Are
  big comebacks just much more common nowadays?" and other questions, plus includes a
  few notes on how this project was put together.

* :doc:`./dashboard/index`: Provides a configurable plotting tool so you can slice and
  dice the data as you like (including for your favorite team).

* :doc:`./analysis/about`: A little bit about this project.
