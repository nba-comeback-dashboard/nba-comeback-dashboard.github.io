Largest and Smallest Final Scores
=================================

The probability density function of the final score for each team of every game since
1996 is shown below. Remarkably, the 1st and 2nd records since 1996 come from the same
game -- `a double overtime win by Kings over the Clippers 176-175 on 02/24/2023
<https://www.nba.com/game/0022200902>`_.

    <div id="occurs/all_time_scores" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Cumulating the probabilities from left to right gives us this plot, which tells us the
median score of an NBA game since 1996 is 101 points.

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/all_time_scores_or_more" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

.. _max-points-down:

Max Points Down
===============

We can do a similar analysis for the maximum points down at any point in the game. Here
is the probability density function, which tells us that:

* The tightest games ever since 1996 have been within 5 points for the entire game, and
  it's happened 8 times.

* Only about 1,000 games out of 36,000 have been within 8 for the entire game.

* And the biggest blowout ever got up to a whopping 78-point deficit.

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/all_time_max_48_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

And we can integrate it again from left to right to get the probability of being down
max points or more, which tells us the median game runs at least a 17-point deficit.

    <div id="occurs/all_time_max_or_more_48_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

.. _garbage-time-games:

Garbage Time Games  
==================

There's no exact definition of a garbage time game, so I am just going to propose a
working one: being down so much at the 6-minute mark that you have a 1% or less chance
of coming back.  That's maybe to low (maybe 5% or 10% is better) but nevertheless it
gives us a starting point.  With this definition in mind, let's build up the data we
need to count how often we get games that meet this criteria.

We can now look at the point margins exactly at 6 minutes:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/all_time_at_6_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

And again, integrating to get points down or more at 6 minutes:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/all_time_at_or_more_6_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

And this can tell us some interesting things.  `From the dashboard we can see
<https://nba-comeback-dashboard.github.io/dashboard/index.html?p=2&t=6&s=1996-2024-B&m=auto>`_
that:

* If you are down 15 points, you have about a 1% chance of coming back based on
  historical data from 1996.

* The record since 1996 was the Kings came back after being down 22 points at the six-
  minute mark and it was given up by our `Minnesota Timberwolves on 1/27/2020
  <https://www.nba.com/game/0021900696>`_.

Using those two numbers we can say:

* A full 28% of games -- over 1 in 4! -- are effectively over by the 6-minute mark,
  needing a 15-point comeback or more (1% chance or lower).
    
* And 10.4% of games would require a record-setting 23-point comeback.

That's a lot of garbage time games. Even though about 35% of games are within 6-7
points or less.

To be fair, there could have been more drama before the 6-minute mark. Walking up in
time gets a little better. Looking at the 4th quarter we get:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/all_time_at_or_more_12_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Here:

* `The team down 20 points starting the 4th has about a 1% chance of coming back
  <https://nba-comeback-dashboard.github.io/dashboard/index.html?p=2&t=12&s=1996-2024-B&m=auto>`_.
  And only about 13-14% of games is the deficit 20 points or more starting the 4th.
* And games down 28 points or more at the half -- which would require breaking `the
  current record of 27-point 4th quarter comeback
  <https://www.nba.com/game/0020200278>`_ -- only happen about 4% of the time.

And at halftime:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/all_time_at_or_more_24_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

* `Since 1996 there's about a 1% chance of coming back from a 27-point deficit
  <https://nba-comeback-dashboard.github.io/dashboard/index.html?p=2&t=24&s=1996-2024-B&m=auto>`_,
  and that's only 1.5% of all games where the deficit is 27 or more points starting the
  4th.
* The 10% chance of coming back is about 15 points, which is only about 17% of all
  games since 1996.

So it's pretty rare you need to turn off the TV at halftime.

Interestingly, for the playoffs the situation does not change by much.  `From the
dashboard
<https://nba-comeback-dashboard.github.io/dashboard/index.html?p=2&t=6&s=1996-2024-P&m=auto>`_
the 1% point of combing back is again about 15 points.  And as we can see:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/all_time_playoffs_at_or_more_6_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

about 29-30% of games meet this criteria, an increase of 1%.  This surprised me, as I
would have guessed there would have been many more tighter, competitive games during
the playoffs.

Comparing Old School (1996-2016) to Modern (2017-2024)
======================================================

Shift in Final Scores
---------------------

There has been a remarkable shift in the final scores of NBA games, with the median
score in the modern era being about 111 points versus 97 in the past, a 14-point shift.
And this is a static shift in the mean of the data; the slope or standard deviation
remains almost perfectly constant:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/old_school_v_modern_scores" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/old_school_v_modern_scores_or_more" class="nbacd-chart"></div>


.. _comparing-occurs-eras-max-points-down:

Max Points Down
---------------

Looking at a chart comparing max points down or more:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/old_school_v_modern_max_or_more_48_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Now, teams fall down:

* 30 points or more ``~12.2%`` of the time compared to ``~7.6%`` in the past, a notable
  1.59x increase (or about 59% more frequently).

* 20 points or more ``~18.8%`` of the time compared to ``~14.3%`` in the past, a
  not-quite-as-dramatic 1.31x increase (or about 31% more frequently).

.. _comparing-occurs-eras-garbage-time:

Garbage Time Games
------------------

Looking at max down or more at the 6-minute mark, we see a similar shift:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="occurs/old_school_v_modern_at_or_more_6_point_margin" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

But the amount of games where "it's over" stays about the same: while there are more
games with larger deficits, this is offset by modern teams being able to overcome about
:doc:`2-3 more points at the same probability as in the past </analysis/20_is_new_18>`.
