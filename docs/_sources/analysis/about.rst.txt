   Feel free to `email me <mailto:nba.comeback.dashboard@gmail.com>`_ or `click here if
   you would like to tip this work <https://buymeacoffee.com/nba.comeback.dashboard>`_
   so I can buy some more tokens.

This project started when I was :doc:`trying to examine a rule of thumb
</analysis/rule_of_thumb_that_actually_works>` about how safe leads are while watching
NBA games and I wanted to create :doc:`a chart I could reference when watching games
</analysis/goto_chart>`.

While showing a friend some of the data, he suggested that I :doc:`should try using AI
to code </analysis/using_claude_code>` the front end for this project since -- in my
day job writing scientific computing software -- we aren't allowed to use AI on our
main codebase. So this was a perfect opportunity to experiment.

.. I quickly :doc:`settled on using Claude Code </analysis/using_claude_code>` and had
   it build the majority of the JavaScript front end for this site.
