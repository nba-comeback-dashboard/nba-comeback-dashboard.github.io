Home v. Away All Time
=====================

Looking at all the available data since 1996, the shift between the home team versus
the road team is roughly 4 points. This number depends :doc:`on our comeback condition
</analysis/understanding_and_using_the_plots>`.  Looking at max points down or more for
the entire game, we see about a 3.5 point shift:

But looking at the odds of coming back from a point deficit at the half, the chances of
coming back from a 20 point deficit for the home team is about the same as the road
team coming back from down 16, a four point shift:

And, as expected, gets smaller as the amount of time dwindles:

Home v. Away Modern Era
=======================

In recent years, this shift has lessened, showing greater parity between the home and
the road team. Here, the shift is about 3 points or less rather than 4 (e.g. a home
team down 20 points has about the same odds as a road team being down 17).  And the
shift is not as stable, with the home team advantage lessening for big comebacks.

Notably, the 1% chance of comeback is much closer recently:
