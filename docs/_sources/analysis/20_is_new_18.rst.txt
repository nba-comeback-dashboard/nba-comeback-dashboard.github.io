Are Big Leads No Longer Safe?
=============================

There's a perception that, in recent times, teams are climbing out of big deficits more
often than ever before. Just as `Kevin Pelton and Baxter Holmes noted in 2019
<https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26725776/this-season-massive-comeback-nba>`_, so
did ESPN reporter Andrew Lopez in `'20 is the old 12': Why no lead is safe in the NBA
anymore
<https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39698420/no-lead-safe-nba-big-comebacks-blown-leads>`_.
There he points out that the 2023-24 season had already seen the most 20-point
comebacks in a single season since 1996-97 and continues with analysis by Steve Kerr:

.. pull-quote::

    "Way more early possession 3s now. It just feels like you are up 12 and the other
    team gets two quick stops on you and they race down, they throw it ahead and they
    hit two 3s. It's a six-point game now. So 20 is the old 12; 12 is the old seven. I
    mean, there's definitely an awareness from everybody that leads are not safe."


But is this true? In short... not really.

To frame this, I decided to break up the available play-by-play data into:

* 1996-97 to 2016-17 (old-school) versus
* 2017-18 to 2024-25 (modern)

(:ref:`As explained below <deciding-on-eras-breakdown>`, a more targeted recent modern
era does not change the analysis so the larger dataset was chosen).
 
To be clear, there has been a marked shift in the data: there are about 1.8 times as
many 20-points-or-more comebacks comparing the eras.  However, the *chance* of coming
back from 20 points-or-more down (``~5.3%``) is about the same as coming back from 18
points-or-more down (``~4.9%``) in the earlier era.  To put this in perspective, this
overall ~2 point shift is on par to :doc:`the advantage a home team has over a road
team </analysis/home_v_away>` when attempting a comeback.

This means leads are *roughly* as safe as they have been, perhaps needing an extra
bucket to maintain the same level of security.

.. _win-percentages-when-max-deficit-is-n-or-more-points:

Win Percentages When Max Deficit is N *Or More* Points
======================================================

:ref:`A very common way of looking at comebacks<max-points-down-or-more>` is
calculating the % chance of coming back from down N points *or more* over an entire
game:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/max_down_or_more_48" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

An insight is that percent chance of coming back versus point deficit is normally
distributed under most conditions.  So when plotted on a `normal probability plot
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_probability_plot>`_ and :doc:`we fit trend lines
(e.g. fit a normal model) to the statistical data
</analysis/methodology_forming_the_plot_trend_lines>` we can then better examine the
lower probability events and also more easily compare different eras or situations. And
when comparing these two eras, we can see a mostly stable and constant shift of about
2-3 points to the left for the modern era versus the past.

You can :ref:`interact with this chart <using-the-plot-controls>` and hover over and
click the points to see which games compose a point and compare it with a `list of
biggest comebacks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comeback_(sports)#NBA>`_ if so
inclined (on mobile, go full screen before clicking).  To focus on a few we get:

.. list-table:: Win % Increases When Comparing Modern Versus Old School Eras
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Points Down Or More
     - 1996-2016 Win %
     - 2017-2024 Win %
     - Total Win % Increase
   * - 30
     -  0.15 %
     -  0.42 %
     - 2.8x (180% increase)
   * - 20
     - 2.89 %
     - 5.31 %
     - 1.83x (80% increase)
   * - 18
     - 4.88 %
     - 7.93 %
     - 1.59x (60% increase)
   * - 15
     -  9.22 %
     - 12.82 %
     - 1.39x (39% increase)

So while coming back from down 30 or more happens 2.8 times more often than in the
past, it's still very unlikely. In fact, you need to move over a little less than one
three-pointer to get about the same chance: in the old school era, if you were down -27
or more there was about a ``~0.50%`` chance of winning. And being down 20 or more now
has just about the same chance of winning as being down 18 or more back in the day
(``~5.0%``).

.. green-box::

    Note, this uses the raw data points, which is a little more intuitive. You can also
    do this using the trend line in the chart, which cleans up the noise in the data
    and is statistically more accurate. Overall, either way draws the same conclusion.

As time dwindles, this shift is slightly smaller. Looking at biggest 4th quarter
comebacks we get:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/max_down_or_more_12" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Now, the shift is about 1.5 points, an even smaller shift.

To me at least, looking at the point shift gives me a better feel for how dramatically
(or not) the game has changed. I can be convinced you could look at it both ways (Win %
Increase is more dramatic, point shift is more modest), but as a fan watching your team
sink into a 20 point hole, I don't think the data is telling you to say "20 points,
that's nothing anymore".


.. _win-percentages-when-teams-are-down-n-points-with-so-much-time-left:

Win Percentages When Teams Are Down N Points With So Much Time Left
===================================================================

:ref:`Another way to look at it and the more natural way to think about it while you
are watching a game live<points-down-at-time>` (as opposed to describing a game after
the fact) is to look at the win percentages when teams are down *exactly* N points with
so much time left. Here's a chart for the start of the 2nd half:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/down_at_24" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

The data is a bit noisier here, because we are not accumulating the games as we move
from left to right like we did when looking at points down *or more*. Here, for the old
school era, we have the case that there was one game (``11/27/1996 DEN @ UTA:
103-107``) where UTA was down -34 at the half and won. But no team in that era won when
down *exactly* -33, -32, -31, -30 or -29 at the half.

Now, the divide here is a little larger: being down -20 in the modern era is about the
same as being down 16.5 points in the old school era (3.5 point shift).

But as time decreases it tightens up -- looking at starting the 4th quarter we see that
being 20 points down (``~0.17%``) is about the same as 17.8 points down when comparing
new to old:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/down_at_12" class="nbacd-chart"></div>


And entering the final 6 minutes it gets tighter still:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/down_at_6" class="nbacd-chart"></div>


.. _20-is-18-win-versus-time:

Win % Versus Time
=================

Collecting this data for every minute, :ref:`we can focus on a single percentage and
plot the time v point deficit for that percentage
<percent-chance-of-winning-time-v-points-down>`.  Doing that for 10% while comparing
the eras we get:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/percent_plot_10_percent" class="nbacd-chart"></div>


And doing it for 1% we get:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/percent_plot_1_percent" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

The point spread changes over time, but between 2 - 3 points is a fairly good
characterization.


.. _occurrence-frequencies:

Occurrence Frequencies
======================

In a certain sense, the fact that teams can score more quickly does not automatically
lead to the conclusion that big comebacks should be more probable: I mean, if you are
down and can score quickly, so can your opponent and keep you down.

So a related question is: are there simply more games with large deficits? Plotting the
occurrence rate between the eras we see:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="plots/old_school_v_modern/occurs_down_or_more_48" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Now, teams fall down 30 points or more ``~12%`` of the time compared to ``~7.6%`` in
the past, a notable 1.59x increase (or about 59% more frequently).




.. _what-an-8-point-shift-looks-like:

What An 8 Point Shift Looks Like
================================

When I started to compare the modern versus old school eras, I was expecting (based on
the current perception out there) that the shift was going to be large.  When it
wasn't, I assumed there were simply bugs in my setup and I spent a lot of time sanity
checking the results (and, if I still have mistakes, lines are open).

In that context, I thought it would be useful to get a sense of what an 8 point shift
looks like and the kind of trend I was expecting to see.  So if we look at top 10 teams
(out of 30) vs. bottom 10 teams in the modern era we get:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="20_18/dramatic" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Here, the chance of top ten team playing a bottom 10 team coming back from a
20-points-or-more deficit (``~20%``) is about the same for any team coming back from 12
or more down against any other team.

.. _deciding-on-eras-breakdown:

Why I Chose My Years Breakdown
==============================

If you:

* :doc:`Break up the old school eras into two even decades from 1996-2006 v 2007-2016
  </analysis/plots/old_old_school_v_old_school>` you can see there is very little shift
  in the numbers.

* Similarly, if you :doc:`break up the modern era into the more fine grained 4 year
  chunks of 2017-2020 v 2021-2024 </analysis/plots/new_school_v_new_new_school>` you
  again see very little difference.

So -- always wanting as many games as possible to reduce the statistical noise -- I
felt that was the fairest breakdown: :doc:`1996-2016 v
2017-2024</analysis/plots/old_school_v_modern>`.  I also tried to create the most
dramatic shift possible between something considered modern versus historical.
