Goto Chart: The Only Chart You Really Need

All The Available Data
======================

Overall, I feel the most useful dashboard chart is this one:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="goto/nbacd_points_versus_36_time_all_eras" class="nbacd-chart"></div>


This includes all games from 1996 (~36,000 games) and -- if you're down -- gives you a
pretty good sense of how steep of a mountain your team has to climb (and of course on
the flip side how safe your lead is).  Plus, I like being able to see the current
record for a given time, knowing that if you are beyond the record it would be, well, a
record if you came back.  (And, ahem, our :doc:`Minnesota Timberwolves
</analysis/do_the_twolves_give_up_big_leads>` hold or tie the record for allowing the
biggest comeback at the 3, 6, 7, and 10 minute marks).

You can click on data points and see which game(s) hold the record.  Going full screen
makes it easier (and on mobile, you have to go full screen first -- also, on mobile, it
helps to rotate the screen, go full screen, and then you can click on any point to get
the summary for that minute).

Please note, the 'Record' is calculated by getting the point margin exactly at that
minute mark, so if a team was down 25 at the start of the 4th and then went down 26 and
then back to 25 by the 11th minute, the 26 is not recorded here.

Modern Era
==========

Of course, this is all games -- regular season, play-in, and playoffs -- and this
:doc:`chart will change if you change the conditions
</analysis/rule_of_thumb_that_actually_works>`.  For example, if we limit it to the
last 8 years (modern era) you get:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="goto/nbacd_points_versus_36_time_modern_era" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

But overall, I don't think this is that drastically different, and I like to see the
all-time-since-1996 record so I generally prefer the first chart. And if you limit it
to, say, just the playoffs for most practical purposes the numbers are the same:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="goto/nbacd_points_versus_36_time_modern_era_playoffs" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Looking at the 9 minute mark and the 1% chance line, all-time-since-1996 is about 17
points down, it's about 18 for the modern era last eight years, and ~16.5 points for
the playoffs games in the modern era (more evidence :doc:`that the comeback chances
haven't changed as drastically as popular perception </analysis/20_is_new_18>`).

Some conditions (like top 10 playing bottom 10 team) will change this chart a lot, but
overall I think the first chart does a pretty good job of calibrating where you are
based on the current point deficit.

Supplementals
=============

Sometimes, watching a Timberwolves game, a chart like this limited to our recent
history is useful to look at during the break:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="goto/twolves_leads_12_recent" class="nbacd-chart"></div>

Just to get a sense of what we're capable of, but really the first chart sets similar
expectations.
